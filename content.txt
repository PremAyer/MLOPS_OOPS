1.class and object with examples
2.class has data/attributes and func/methods
   .code walkthrough
   .attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3.why python is called oop?
Ans: Because anything random datatype like lst,dict,set all are written inside class.
4.Advantages of oops:
  . you can create your own datatype
  . code reusability
  . debugging
  . easy to colab 

5. End to end project (chatbook class)
  . Function vs method 
  . Magic method or dhunder method
  . Self
  . you can create attributes outside the class as well
  . Encapsulation
  . getter and setter
  . static method

6. Inheritance 
  . Inheritance code examples
  . why inheritance is needed? (code reuability,parent has no access to the child class)
  . what gets inherited? - Constructor,Non private attributes, Non privated method
  . constructor overloading and method overloading 
  . super keyword(can be used only inside the class , cannot access variables/attributes,used only inside child class)
  . Types of inheritance - 1.single inheritance, 2. Multilevel, 3. Hierarchical, 4. Multiple<Diamond Problem>, 5.Hybrid
